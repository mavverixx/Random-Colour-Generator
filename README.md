# Random Colour Generator

This is a simple yet engaging Random Colour Generator that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases clean code practices with a focus on user interaction, DOM manipulation, and dynamic styling.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Build a Random Colour Generator that:
- Generates a random RGB colour on button click.
- Updates the colour display area with the new colour.
- Logs each generation action to the console.

### Links

- **Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mavverixx/Random-Colour-Generator)
- **Live Site:** [Live Demo URL](https://your-live-site-url.com)  *(update with your current live URL if available)*

## My Process

### Built With

The project is built using:
- **HTML5:** Provides the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Handles the visual presentation, layout, and styling.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the interactive random colour generation feature.
  
### What I Learned

Through this project, I gained insights into:
- Dynamically updating DOM elements to reflect new styling.
- Effectively handling events to create interactive user experiences.
- Structuring simple projects in a maintainable way.
  
Example JavaScript snippet:
```js
const randomColor = `rgb(${Math.floor(Math.random() * 256)}, ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 256)}, ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 256)})`;
colourBox.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
```

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to:

Enhance the visual transitions for smoother colour changes.
Add a feature that records and displays a history of generated colours.
Provide user controls for saving preferred colours.

### Useful Resources

Some of the resources that helped during development include:

MDN Web Docs for documentation on web technologies.
CSS-Tricks for practical tips on styling and layout.
JavaScript Info for in-depth JavaScript tutorials.
